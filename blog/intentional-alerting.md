## Lessons from Personal Tech and Enterprise IT

Notifications and alerts are everywhere in our always-on, connected world. But as I've learned from personal experience and my work in enterprise IT, more alerts don't always mean better outcomes. In fact, too many alerts can be completely counterproductive.

My journey with intentional alerting began with my Apple Watch. At first, I was excited to have every app sending me real-time updates. But I quickly felt overwhelmed by the constant buzzing on my wrist. I was being pulled out of the moment, distracted from what I was doing, all to check alerts that were rarely urgent or needed action.

So I made a change. I turned off notifications for everything except essential real-time communications that need immediate responses, like calls, texts, and critical messaging apps. The result? I'm more focused, less stressed, and I've taken back control of my attention.

This principle of intentional alerting is just as powerful in IT, especially networking. Too often, companies take a "more is better" approach to alerts, either leaving every possible notification on or hesitating to turn any off for fear of missing something important. The result is a flood of alerts that quickly overwhelms teams and leads to alert fatigue and lack of ownership.

The solution is to be ruthlessly intentional about which alerts are enabled and how they're managed. Every alert should have a clear owner and a defined action plan. If you can't explain who's responsible for an alert and what they should do about it, that's a warning sign that the alert might not be necessary.

One effective tool for this is what I call an "alert dictionary" â€” a central resource that maps out key information for each alert, such as:

- Who owns the alert

- What specific actions should be taken in response
