## A Matter of Western Digital Privilege

In a recent conversation about IPv6 adoption at a Western technology company, a familiar scene played out. Engineers and architects discussed IPv6 implementation as an optional future consideration rather than an immediate necessity. 'We don't really need it yet', was the prevailing sentiment. This perspective, common among Western organisations, reveals a profound blindspot born of privilege – one that unconsciously perpetuates digital inequality on a global scale.

### The Historical Echo in Digital Infrastructure

The root of this privilege lies in the historical distribution of IPv4 addresses, a story that mirrors colonial patterns of resource distribution. North American organisations control nearly 40% of the IPv4 address space. European and Asia-Pacific regions each hold about a quarter. Latin America and Africa together possess less than 8% of these crucial digital resources. This disparity reflects neither population sizes nor current internet needs, but rather the accident of timing in internet adoption and the power structures of the late 20th century.

The consequences of this imbalance are playing out dramatically in Africa today. AFRINIC, the regional internet registry for Africa, faces a crisis of IPv4 exhaustion. Across their allocated blocks, utilisation rates hover above 95%, with most blocks completely depleted. New organisations in Africa aren't choosing IPv6 adoption – they're being forced into it by necessity. Meanwhile, many Western organisations continue to view IPv6 adoption as optional, insulated from the urgency by their abundant IPv4 holdings.

### The Hidden Cost of Digital Inequality

This stark contrast in circumstances has created a two-tier internet. Western organisations, wealthy in IPv4 resources, can continue business as usual, trading and communicating with other IPv4-rich entities while remaining largely insulated from the addressing crisis affecting much of the global South. It's a form of digital privilege that goes largely unrecognised by its beneficiaries.

The implications extend far beyond mere technical inconvenience. Organisations in developing regions must either purchase increasingly expensive IPv4 addresses on the secondary market or implement complex NAT solutions, adding costs and complexity to their infrastructure. These additional burdens consume resources that could otherwise be invested in innovation and growth. The need to work around IPv4 scarcity effectively places a tax on digital development in regions that can least afford it.

When Western organisations delay IPv6 adoption, they're not making a purely technical decision. They're inadvertently perpetuating a system of digital inequality. By maintaining IPv4-only infrastructure, they force organisations with fewer IPv4 resources to bear the burden of maintaining dual-stack environments. The resistance to IPv6 adoption delays the network effects that would benefit the entire internet ecosystem, particularly those most constrained by IPv4 scarcity.

### From Privilege to Responsibility

The path forward requires reframing IPv6 adoption from technical necessity to social responsibility. Organisations with significant IPv4 holdings have a unique opportunity – and obligation – to lead in this transition, not despite their IPv4 wealth, but because of it. This isn't just about implementing new protocols; it's about acknowledging our position of privilege and using it to create a more equitable digital future.

Consider the current situation in Africa, where AFRINIC's exhaustion statistics tell a stark story. In their 102/8 block, only 5.97% of addresses remain available. The 105/8, 154/8, and 197/8 blocks are effectively exhausted, with availability at or near zero. This scarcity directly impacts Africa's ability to grow its digital infrastructure and participate fully in the global digital economy. While Western organisations debate the timeline for IPv6 adoption, African organisations face immediate constraints on their ability to expand and compete.

The choice to adopt IPv6 isn't just about technical infrastructure – it's about whether we want to perpetuate historical inequities or help create a more level playing field in the global digital economy. As stewards of significant IPv4 resources, Western organisations have the power to lead this transition. By implementing IPv6 alongside existing IPv4 infrastructure, sharing knowledge about deployment best practices, and using market influence to demand IPv6 support from vendors, they can help break down the barriers to a more inclusive internet.

The conversation about IPv6 adoption needs to shift from technical necessity to digital equity. Our ability to ignore IPv6 isn't a sign that it's unnecessary – it's a reflection of historical privilege in address allocation. By recognising this privilege and acting to address it through proactive IPv6 adoption, we can work towards a more equitable digital future, one where technical infrastructure supports rather than hinders global participation in the digital economy.

The time has come to acknowledge that our IPv4 privilege comes with a responsibility to lead in building a more inclusive internet infrastructure. The question isn't whether IPv6 is necessary – it's whether we're willing to use our position of privilege to help create a more equitable digital world.
