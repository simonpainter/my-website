## More than just an interview question

I've sat on both sides of countless technical interviews over my years in networking. There's this familiar dance that happens when discussing OSPF: the candidate confidently states "OSPF uses Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation," and I'll nod approvingly. But here's the thing - in hundreds of these exchanges, I've never once asked a candidate to explain what that actually means, and no one's ever asked me to explain it either.

This mention of Dijkstra has become almost ceremonial in our industry. We repeat it without truly engaging with what it means for our networks. Yet understanding this algorithm isn't just academic - it shapes how OSPF operates, influences our network designs, and explains why certain patterns have become best practices.

When a link fails in your network and OSPF starts recalculating routes, there's computational work happening that many engineers never consider. This processing isn't just theoretical - it's a real factor behind many design decisions, from area sizing to adjacency limits.

Today, I want to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Let's explore how this algorithm shapes the way we deploy OSPF networks and why it matters for day-to-day operations.

## How Dijkstra's Algorithm Actually Works in OSPF

When we talk about path-finding algorithms in computing, several approaches stand out. Breadth-First Search explores methodically layer by layer, Depth-First Search dives deep into each possible path, and Greedy Best-First Search always chooses what looks most promising.

Dijkstra's algorithm, which OSPF uses, takes a more thorough approach. Unlike algorithms that make decisions based on estimates or heuristics, Dijkstra focuses on actual distances travelled. This makes it perfect for routing protocols where we need guaranteed optimal paths based on real metrics.

Each OSPF router maintains a detailed map of network topology through Link State Advertisements (LSAs). When calculating routes, the router positions itself as the root of a tree and starts evaluating paths to every known destination. It tracks the actual cost of reaching each destination, storing these in a priority queue that processes the most promising paths first.

Think of it like planning a journey where you need absolute certainty about the cheapest route. You can't make assumptions about which direction looks promising - you must check every path based on actual costs. This methodical approach guarantees finding the optimal path, but it comes with computational overhead.

This characteristic - looking backwards at actual costs rather than forward at estimates - makes Dijkstra particularly suitable for routing protocols where accuracy matters most. However, it's also why OSPF requires more computational resources than protocols using simpler methods.

## Why This Matters: OSPF's Real-World Constraints

Understanding how Dijkstra's algorithm works reveals why OSPF networks face certain scaling challenges. But here's where I need to correct some common misconceptions about these limitations.

The computational complexity often gets oversimplified in networking discussions. You'll frequently hear that Dijkstra has O(V²) complexity, where V represents the number of routers. This creates the impression that doubling your routers means quadrupling the computational work. But this isn't quite right for real networks.

That V² complexity assumes the worst-case scenario - a complete graph where every router connects directly to every other router. In graph theory terms, this is called a dense graph. But networks aren't built this way. We deal with sparse graphs, where the number of actual connections is far below the theoretical maximum.

Let me give you a concrete example. Consider a leaf-spine data centre with 400 leaf switches and 8 spine switches - that's 408 routers total. The theoretical maximum connections would be over 160,000 (408²). But in reality, each leaf connects only to the 8 spines, giving us just 3,200 actual connections. That's only 2% of the theoretical maximum.

Modern implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm using optimised data structures achieve O((V + E) log V) complexity, where E is the number of edges (links). For sparse networks like ours, this changes the scaling story completely.

Here's what this means in practice. Modern control plane processors running at multi-gigahertz speeds can handle these calculations in dozens of microseconds, not the milliseconds often suggested. The traditional guidance of limiting areas to 50-100 routers comes from the 1990s, when processing power was orders of magnitude lower.

But don't misunderstand - I'm not saying OSPF scales infinitely. Computational overhead is still a factor, just not the primary constraint it's often made out to be.

## The Real Scaling Factors

So if raw computation isn't the main limit, what actually constrains OSPF scaling?

### LSA Flooding Overhead

When topology changes happen, LSAs must flood throughout the area. This creates network traffic and processing overhead that grows with the number of routers. Even if each router can calculate paths quickly, they all need to receive and process these updates.

### Memory Usage

Each router must maintain the complete topology database for its area. As areas grow, this memory requirement increases. While modern routers have plenty of RAM, this still represents a real constraint in resource-limited environments.

### Convergence Complexity

Larger areas mean more potential failure scenarios and more complex interactions during convergence. Even with fast individual calculations, coordinating network-wide convergence becomes more challenging.

### Operational Complexity

Troubleshooting and managing larger OSPF areas becomes increasingly difficult. When something goes wrong, having hundreds of routers in a single area makes problem isolation much harder.

These factors explain why area design guidelines persist even with more powerful hardware. It's not that we can't handle the computation - it's that other factors become problematic first.

## Why BGP Scales Where OSPF Struggles

The contrast between OSPF and BGP shows us different approaches to the scalability challenge. OSPF uses Dijkstra's algorithm to mathematically prove it has found the best path to every destination. BGP takes a completely different approach.

BGP doesn't try to discover or calculate the best path. Instead, it follows a set of rules to choose among paths it learns through advertisements. This process is computationally simple: compare path attributes one by one until you find a difference. Higher local preference? Choose that path. Equal? Check AS path length. Still equal? Move to the next tie-breaker.

This attribute-based decision making has linear computational complexity O(n), where n is the number of paths to evaluate. When a BGP router receives a path update, it just compares the new path's attributes against the current choice - no complex tree calculations needed.

Consider the Internet's routing table with over 900,000 prefixes. Running Dijkstra across a topology of this scale would be computationally expensive. But BGP handles this efficiently because each prefix gets processed independently using simple comparisons.

The trade-off is clear. BGP might not always choose the path with the lowest metric - it selects based on configured preferences. This is why Internet traffic sometimes takes seemingly indirect paths, following business relationships rather than geographic efficiency. But this sacrifice of mathematical optimality enables BGP to scale massively.

This explains why BGP dominates large-scale networks whilst OSPF stays in smaller domains where path optimality matters more than massive scalability. Each protocol makes different trade-offs for different needs.

## Practical Design Implications

Understanding OSPF's real constraints should shape your network design decisions. Here's what actually matters:

### Area Size and Structure

The traditional 50-100 router limit per area isn't about raw computation anymore, but it's still valid for other reasons. LSA flooding, convergence complexity, and operational management become the real constraints. Area 0 design remains crucial - keep your backbone area lean and stable.

### Topology Design

Full mesh designs create problems not because of computational complexity, but because of the operational overhead and potential failure scenarios they create. Hub-and-spoke or partial mesh topologies limit complexity whilst maintaining redundancy.

### Network Types and DR/BDR Selection

Using Designated Routers on broadcast segments reduces LSA flooding and simplifies topology management. Point-to-point links remain preferable where possible because they're easier to troubleshoot and manage.

### Convergence and Timer Tuning

SPF timers need to balance rapid convergence against stability. Even with fast modern processors, you don't want routers constantly recalculating during network instability. Back-to-back calculations can still impact performance, especially in virtual environments where CPU resources might be shared.

## OSPF's Place in Modern Networks

The networking landscape has changed dramatically since OSPF's introduction. Where we once saw OSPF spanning global enterprise networks, modern architectures have reshaped its role.

### The Shrinking OSPF Domain

Enterprise WANs now run BGP, whether for MPLS services, SD-WAN overlays, or direct cloud connectivity. This has effectively contained OSPF to campus and data centre environments. But these environments have evolved significantly.

Today's data centre networks present unique challenges. A modern data centre pod can easily contain hundreds of devices in dense configurations. Leaf-spine architectures create exactly the kind of topology density that tests OSPF's limits - not because of computational complexity, but because of operational and convergence challenges.

### Looking Forward

OSPF continues to evolve with features like segment routing and traffic engineering extensions. Its guarantee of optimal paths remains valuable in scenarios where network topology is well-defined and manageable.

The key lesson isn't that OSPF is becoming less relevant. It's that understanding its real constraints - not just the theoretical ones - helps us deploy it effectively. Whether you're designing a campus network or a data centre pod, factors like LSA flooding, convergence complexity, and operational management will shape your decisions more than raw computational limits.

Modern hardware has largely solved the computational scaling problems that concerned us decades ago. But OSPF still has scaling constraints - they're just different from what we often assume. Understanding these real limitations helps us make better design decisions and deploy OSPF where it works best.

### A Note on Recent Research

Recent academic research has pushed the boundaries of shortest path algorithms even further. In July 2025, researchers from Tsinghua University and Stanford published a breakthrough showing that Dijkstra's algorithm isn't theoretically optimal for single-source shortest paths. They developed a deterministic algorithm with O(m log^(2/3) n) complexity that beats Dijkstra's O(m + n log n) bound on sparse graphs.

This represents a significant theoretical advance in computer science. However, the practical implications for networking protocols like OSPF are limited. The new algorithm uses complex recursive partitioning and specialised data structures that would be challenging to implement in distributed routing protocols. The constant factors and implementation complexity mean that for the network sizes we typically see in OSPF deployments, Dijkstra's algorithm remains the practical choice.

This research does reinforce the point about sparse graphs though - real networks don't approach the theoretical density that makes Dijkstra's worst-case complexity problematic. The academic work confirms that our earlier analysis about sparse network topologies was on the right track.
