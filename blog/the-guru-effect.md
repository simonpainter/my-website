## Breaking the Technical Hierarchy Trap

In tech, we often assume technical teams should be led by the most technically skilled people. This common thinking, while it seems sensible, might actually be stopping organisations from reaching their full potential. Promoting technical experts to management creates a range of problems that affect everything from innovation to career growth.

### The guru effect

Think about when a brilliant architect or technical lead gets promoted to management. Their technical expertise—the very thing that earned them the promotion—often becomes a bottleneck. When one person's technical opinion weighs more than others, decision-making centralizes. Teams start deferring to this authority rather than openly discussing solutions. Innovation slows down, and the company unknowingly creates a single point of failure where all important decisions must pass through one person's technical viewpoint.

This "guru effect" creates problems that cascade through the organisation. Junior developers start second-guessing themselves, waiting for the technical leader's approval instead of exploring new approaches. Code reviews turn into exercises in matching the guru's preferred patterns rather than meaningful discussions. The team slows down as pull requests queue up, waiting for the one person qualified to approve them. What's more, the technical leader gets overwhelmed, trying to juggle management duties with being the final judge on all technical decisions.

The damage goes deeper than just slower delivery. Team members slowly lose their sense of ownership and freedom. They stop bringing new ideas to discussions, knowing that any major difference from the guru's preferred approach will likely be rejected. This creates a single way of thinking, where everyone's work starts to mirror one person's views and biases. Innovation stalls not because the team can't do better, but because they don't feel safe challenging the established patterns.

### The single point of decision-making

This technical hierarchy also puts the organisation's technical sustainability at risk. When all key decisions must go through one person, their absence—whether from illness, holiday, or leaving—can paralyse the team. Knowledge concentrates in one place instead of being shared, creating risks for succession planning and business continuity. The guru becomes essential, but in the worst way possible: they're a single point of failure in the company's technical decision-making.

Perhaps most insidiously, this pattern tends to self-reinforce. As team members become more dependent on the technical leader's guidance, their own technical decision-making skills atrophy. The gap between the guru and the team widens, making it increasingly difficult to distribute technical leadership more evenly in the future. The organisation becomes trapped in a cycle where every technical decision, no matter how small, must be blessed by the authority at the top.

### The lack of influence

This situation becomes particularly problematic when we examine why technical experts typically move into management roles. Often, it's because management is seen as the only path to greater influence and higher compensation within an organisation. This creates a troubling paradox: organisations effectively remove their most skilled practitioners from hands-on technical work, placing them in roles that might not align with their strengths or interests. Meanwhile, the technical team loses valuable expertise and the organisation reinforces the notion that management is the only way up the career ladder.

But there's an alternative approach worth considering. When technical teams are led by managers who possess strong business acumen and basic technical literacy—rather than deep technical expertise—something interesting happens. These managers, unburdened by strong technical biases, can facilitate more democratic technical discussions. They focus on outcomes rather than implementation details, encouraging diverse viewpoints from the entire team.

### The collective responsibility

These non-technical managers (and by non-technical, we mean those with the level of understanding that translates to C-suite leaders rather than having in-depth technical knowledge) excel at aligning technical efforts with business priorities. They bridge the communication gap between technical teams and executive leadership, translating business needs into technical context and vice versa. This alignment becomes increasingly crucial as organisations face complex decisions about prioritising technical innovation, architectural purity, or business objectives.

When managers don't hold technical authority, technical teams often develop stronger collective ownership of decisions. The peer review process becomes more robust, and innovation flourishes through the integration of diverse perspectives. Technical leadership skills develop organically across the team, creating a more resilient organisation.

### The 'non technical' person

However, it's crucial to address a troubling trend in business: the pride some people take in declaring themselves "not technical." In today's digital age, this stance is becoming as professionally limiting as proudly proclaiming illiteracy or innumeracy. Every business leader needs a basic understanding of technology to make informed decisions. This doesn't mean writing code or designing systems, but rather understanding technical concepts and their business implications well enough to engage meaningfully with technical teams.

The ideal technical team structure, therefore, might not be one led by technical experts, but rather by business-savvy managers who understand enough about technology to be effective while maintaining focus on broader organisational goals. These managers succeed by enabling rather than directing technical decisions, preserving technical talent while promoting collective decision-making.

### The balancing act

This approach requires a delicate balance. Managers need enough technical literacy to understand the implications of technical decisions without feeling compelled to make those decisions themselves. They must excel at facilitation, ensuring all technical voices are heard while keeping discussions aligned with business objectives. Most importantly, they need to create an environment where technical leadership is distributed across the team rather than concentrated in a single position.

The transformation to this model isn't simple, but its benefits are compelling. Organisations that successfully implement this approach often find their technical teams becoming more innovative, efficient, and aligned with business objectives. Technical experts remain engaged in what they do best, while developing leadership skills in a more organic way. Meanwhile, managers can focus on what truly matters: enabling their teams to deliver value to the organisation.

The key lies not in eliminating technical leadership but in redistributing it across the team while providing business-focused management that enables rather than directs technical decisions. This model can lead to more innovative, efficient, and aligned technical organisations, better equipped to meet the challenges of our businesses.
