## The Mystery Begins

The reason I fell down the rabbit hole with regard to [finding my public ip](../finding-my-ip.md) was because of a section in an old Azure networking book my friend was reading which said:

>To allow Azure internal communication between resources in Virtual Networks and Azure services, Azure assigns public IP
>addresses to VMs, which identifies them internally. Let's call these public IP addresses AzPIP (this is an unofficial
>abbreviation). You can check the Azure internal Public IP address bound to the VM with the command
>dig TXT short o-o.myaddr.google.com.
<!-- truncate -->
[Page Source](img/azure-networking.jpg)

This led to a bit of Friday night investigation as we wanted to know what this IP was and what it was for and also why it appeared to be different from the one used for the default outbound internet access. I mention default internet outbound internet access because that was the first thing we checked, comparing the result from the test mentioned in the book with what happens if you do one of the other tests for [finding your public ip](../finding-my-ip.md) like `curl ident.me` and others.

## Initial Investigation

Using dig to look up the text record from o-o.myaddr.google.com returns the IP of the client doing the lookup. What's interesting is that you get a different response depending on where you look it up - suggesting different interfaces with different routes exist under the hood in the Azure NIC.

### Test Case 1: VM with Public IP

With a VM that has a single NIC and a [PIP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses) assigned, you get two different IPs:

```bash
simon@vm1:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com +short
"51.140.144.96"
simon@vm1:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com +short
"20.108.24.23"
```

Note: You get two different answers because in the first case you're connecting to Azure DNS servers, whereas in the second you're connecting to Google DNS out on the internet. The second IP matches what you get from 'curl ident.me'.

## The Plot Thickens

I thought the hidden public IP might provide outbound internet access when there's no PIP associated with the VM. Time to test that theory.

### Test Case 2: VM without Public IP

Spun up a second VM in the vNet without a PIP and hopped across from the other VM:

```bash
simon@vm2:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com +shortgle.com +short
"172.167.198.97"
simon@vm2:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com +short
"51.105.64.87"
```

### Test Case 3: Another VM Check

Just to be thorough, tried another VM without a PIP:

```bash
simon@vm3:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com +short
"172.167.198.97"
simon@vm3:~$ dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com +short
"51.105.65.76"
```

## The Friday Night Experiment

At this point we knew two things pretty much for certain:

-The 'AzPIP' was not the same IP as was used for default outbound internet access.
-There appeared to be an implicit NAT gateway in place because both VM2 and VM3 which didn't have PIPs were sharing the same public IP.

I wanted to know if there was any sharing of this 'AzPIP', it seemed fairly bizarre that there was a public IP assigned to each VM that was basically invisible to the end customer. This led to a  *friday night grade idea*: spin up a load of VMs in the same AZ and have them report their AzPIP. I used a small bit of terraform and a boot up script which looked a bit like this:

```bash
OUTPUT=$(dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com +short | tr -d '"')
curl -s "http://foo.simonpainter.com/?response=$OUTPUT"
```

The idea, silly though it was, involves spinning up as many VM instances as I could and having them run the command from the book to ascertain their 'AzPIP'.

### Initial Results (10 VMs)

```

The script worked but with 10 VMs told me nothing of use. I had to get bigger.

## Next Steps (That Didn't Quite Work Out)

I decided to scale up to 1000 VMs to get a better sample size. This was, predictably, a terrible idea - hit my quota limit, and Friday night is definitely not the best time to try getting that raised. As luck would have it, I managed to get my quota increased to 50 VMs, not quite the 1000 I was aiming for, but enough for a more substantial test. Here are the results from the expanded test:

All VMs reported through the same (new) NAT gateway (52.191.254.129) as the source of their internet connection, but the interesting part was in the reported AzPIPs. The IP `40.78.225.252` was reported by two different VMs within about 11 seconds of each other. While a single duplicate in 50 VMs isn't conclusive, it was the first evidence supporting the theory that these IPs were not unique to the VM NIC.

I still had some open questions so I thought I would go out to the internet to see if anyone knew what these IPs were about.

## My working theories on Friday night

- The duplicate IP in my testing suggested these are not VM level assignments. This means they could be host level.
- It's also possible they are part of a SNAT pool, which would also be a valid explanation for the overlap. Why there would be SNAT between a VM and the Azure DNS is another question altogether.
- How was Google DNS getting the client IP anyway if it was going via Azure DNS.

## A bit of inspiration

When I was out walking my dog on Saturday I managed to nail down the thing that had nagging at the itchy part of the back of my brain. A little while ago I wrote a [python implimentation of a DNS server](https://github.com/simonpainter/pyDNS) for a bit of a laugh so I have a fairly good understanding of the anatomy of a DNS query. There is nowhere in a DNS query for the client IP other than in the usual UDP header and if the query was forwarded on from one DNS server to the other there was no way for the end DNS server to know the IP of the original source client.

So I did a bit of testing on some other boxes sending the query via a bunch of different DNS services and doing my own recursive lookups on a hastily spun up BIND box and that seems to satisfy Occam's Razor sufficiently. The whole page of the book is basically utter garbage and the entire concept of AzPIPs is nonsense!

## What's actually happening

```

When you use `dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com +short` the VM sends the request goes to the Azure DNS server, this then forwards the request to Google's DNS server.

1. Source VM, Destination Azure DNS
2. Source Azure DNS, Destination Google DNS
3. Source VM, Destination Google DNS
4. Source NAT IP, Destination Google DNS

> In the second method, `dig TXT o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com +shortgle.com +short` the path is straight to the
> Google DNS server via the NAT gateway.

So what the Azure networking book author mistook for a secret VM IP turns out to just be the egress IP of the Azure DNS lookups. I feel like a nerdy mythbuster.
