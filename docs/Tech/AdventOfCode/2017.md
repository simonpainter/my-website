### Day 1: Inverse Captcha

#### Part 1

Match digits that repeat in a circular list, where each digit is compared with the next digit.

```python
# Read input as string and process each digit
total = 0
digits = input_string.strip()
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # Compare with next digit (wrapping around to start)
    if digits[i] == digits[i-1]:  # -1 handles wrap-around
        total += int(digits[i])
```

#### Part 2

Similar to part 1, but compare each digit with one halfway around the circular list.

```python
total = 0
digits = input_string.strip()
offset = len(digits) // 2  # Calculate halfway point
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # Compare with digit halfway around (with wraparound)
    if digits[i] == digits[i-offset]:
        total += int(digits[i])

    # Try delays up to LCM
    for delay in range(modulus):
        if all((delay + d) % c != 0 
               for d, c in congruences):
            return delay
```
