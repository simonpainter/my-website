title: The case for non-technical managers in technical teams

## Breaking the Technical Hierarchy Trap

In the tech industry, there's an unspoken assumption that technical teams should be led by those with the deepest technical expertise. This conventional wisdom, while seemingly logical, may actually be holding organisations back from achieving their full potential. The practice of promoting technical experts into management positions creates a complex web of challenges that ripple throughout organisations, affecting everything from innovation to career development.

### The guru effect

Consider the common scenario where a brilliant architect or technical lead gets promoted to a management position. Their technical expertise—the very quality that earned them this promotion—often becomes a bottleneck. When one person's technical opinion carries more weight than others', decision-making becomes centralised. Teams begin to defer to this technical authority rather than engaging in open discourse about solutions. Innovation slows, and the organisation unknowingly creates a single point of failure where critical decisions must flow through one individual's technical perspective.

This "guru effect" creates cascading problems throughout the organisation. Junior developers begin to second-guess their own solutions, waiting for the technical leader's approval rather than exploring innovative approaches. Code reviews become exercises in conforming to the guru's preferred patterns rather than meaningful technical discussions. The team's velocity suffers as pull requests pile up, waiting for the one person deemed qualified to approve them. Even worse, the technical leader often becomes overwhelmed, trying to balance their management responsibilities with being the final arbiter on all technical decisions.

The damage goes deeper than just slowed delivery. Team members gradually lose their sense of ownership and autonomy. They stop bringing fresh ideas to technical discussions, knowing that any significant deviation from the guru's preferred architecture will likely be vetoed. This creates a monoculture of thought, where the entire team's output begins to mirror the perspectives and biases of a single individual. Innovation stagnates not because the team lacks capability, but because they lack the psychological safety to challenge established patterns.

### The single point of decisionmaking

This technical hierarchy also creates a precarious situation for the organisation's technical sustainability. When all crucial decisions flow through one person, that person's absence—whether due to illness, holiday, or departure—can paralyse the team. Knowledge becomes concentrated rather than distributed, creating risks in succession planning and business continuity. The guru becomes indispensable, but in the worst possible way: they're a single point of failure in the organisation's technical decision-making process.

Perhaps most insidiously, this pattern tends to self-reinforce. As team members become more dependent on the technical leader's guidance, their own technical decision-making skills atrophy. The gap between the guru and the team widens, making it increasingly difficult to distribute technical leadership more evenly in the future. The organisation becomes trapped in a cycle where every technical decision, no matter how small, must be blessed by the authority at the top.

### The lack of influence

This situation becomes particularly problematic when we examine why technical experts typically move into management roles. Often, it's because management is seen as the only path to greater influence and higher compensation within an organisation. This creates a troubling paradox: organisations effectively remove their most skilled practitioners from hands-on technical work, placing them in roles that might not align with their strengths or interests. Meanwhile, the technical team loses valuable expertise and the organisation reinforces the notion that management is the only way up the career ladder.

But there's an alternative approach worth considering. When technical teams are led by managers who possess strong business acumen and basic technical literacy—rather than deep technical expertise—something interesting happens. These managers, unburdened by strong technical biases, can facilitate more democratic technical discussions. They focus on outcomes rather than implementation details, encouraging diverse viewpoints from the entire team.

### The collective responsibility

These non-technical managers (and by non-technical, we mean those with the level of understanding that translates to C-suite leaders rather than having in-depth technical knowledge) excel at aligning technical efforts with business priorities. They bridge the communication gap between technical teams and executive leadership, translating business needs into technical context and vice versa. This alignment becomes increasingly crucial as organisations face complex decisions about prioritising technical innovation, architectural purity, or business objectives.

When managers don't hold technical authority, technical teams often develop stronger collective ownership of decisions. The peer review process becomes more robust, and innovation flourishes through the integration of diverse perspectives. Technical leadership skills develop organically across the team, creating a more resilient organisation.

### The 'non technical' person

However, it's crucial to address a troubling trend in business: the pride some people take in declaring themselves "not technical." In today's digital age, this stance is becoming as professionally limiting as proudly proclaiming illiteracy or innumeracy. Every business leader needs a basic understanding of technology to make informed decisions. This doesn't mean writing code or designing systems, but rather understanding technical concepts and their business implications well enough to engage meaningfully with technical teams.

The ideal technical team structure, therefore, might not be one led by technical experts, but rather by business-savvy managers who understand enough about technology to be effective while maintaining focus on broader organisational goals. These managers succeed by enabling rather than directing technical decisions, preserving technical talent while promoting collective decision-making.

### The balancing act

This approach requires a delicate balance. Managers need enough technical literacy to understand the implications of technical decisions without feeling compelled to make those decisions themselves. They must excel at facilitation, ensuring all technical voices are heard while keeping discussions aligned with business objectives. Most importantly, they need to create an environment where technical leadership is distributed across the team rather than concentrated in a single position.

The transformation to this model isn't simple, but its benefits are compelling. Organisations that successfully implement this approach often find their technical teams becoming more innovative, efficient, and aligned with business objectives. Technical experts remain engaged in what they do best, while developing leadership skills in a more organic way. Meanwhile, managers can focus on what truly matters: enabling their teams to deliver value to the organisation.

The key lies not in eliminating technical leadership but in redistributing it across the team while providing business-focused management that enables rather than directs technical decisions. This model can lead to more innovative, efficient, and aligned technical organisations, better equipped to meet the challenges of our businesses.
